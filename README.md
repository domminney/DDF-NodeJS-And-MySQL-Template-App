# DDF-NodeJS-And-MySQL-Template-App

This is the code to go with some videos I am doing for a friend of mine who is learning NodeJS. It's also helping me brush up what I'm doing.

Here's the video series https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLST79JCnF3EzgC20TqO5BS_IGqlqu05Wh

Feel free to politely make suggestions, tell me how out of date my JS is etc :)

This is work in progress and it will only work up to whatever I have covered in the latest video in the playlist
